# Experience Report

## Instructions

For the main project deadline, you will write up the project’s outcomes in the form of a post on the course blog. Your writeup should answer these questions in excruciating, exhaustive detail:

- What was the goal?
- What did you do? (Include both the design and the implementation.)
- What were the hardest parts to get right?
- Were you successful? (Report rigorously on your empirical evaluation.)

As with paper discussions, you can optionally include a video to go along with your blog post.

To submit your report, open a pull request in the course’s GitHub repository to add your post to the blog. In your PR description, please include “closes #N” where N is the issue number for your proposal. The repository README has instructions.
